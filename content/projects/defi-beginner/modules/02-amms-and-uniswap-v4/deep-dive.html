Market makers keep quotes so trading can happen quickly. In DeFi, AMM pools are automated market makers: the pool itself gives you price, and the price updates based on pool balance after each trade.</p><p>So when Maya "buys ETH from a pool," she is not buying from one specific seller. She is moving pool balances according to a formula.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>Constant Product in Plain English</h2><p>A simple pool follows <code>x*y=k</code>. Think of two buckets connected by a rule: if one bucket decreases, the other must increase enough to keep product constant. That is why bigger trades push price more. This is slippage.</p><p>Example: 1000 ETH and 2,000,000 USDC. Product is 2,000,000,000. Buying 10 ETH leaves 990 ETH. USDC side must become about 2,020,202. So buyer pays about 20,202 USDC before fee.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>What Is an LP (Liquidity Provider)?</h2><p>LPs are people like Maya who deposit assets into pool so others can trade. LP earns fees. But LP also carries inventory risk: if price trends strongly, LP may underperform simply holding assets. This is often called impermanent loss.</p><p>So LP return has two parts: fee income and inventory effect. Looking only at fee APR can be misleading.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>Uniswap v2 -> v3 -> v4 (Simple Progression)</h2><ul><li><strong>v2:</strong> one broad pool range, simple constant product.</li><li><strong>v3:</strong> LP chooses price range. More capital efficiency, more active management.</li><li><strong>v4:</strong> adds hooks (custom plugin logic around pool actions), singleton architecture, and flash accounting.</li></ul><p>Important beginner interpretation: v4 is not "better price by magic." It is a framework where pool behavior can be customized, which brings both power and complexity.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>What Is a Hook (No Jargon Version)</h2><p>A hook is a custom function that runs before/after key actions like swap or liquidity update. Example: dynamic fee rule that raises fee during high volatility.</p><p>Think of hooks like optional extensions in software. Extensions can improve experience. They can also add bugs or security risks if poorly designed.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>About "Aggregator" and "Intent Solver"</h2><p>You flagged this correctly, so here is plain meaning:</p><ul><li><strong>Aggregator:</strong> app that checks many pools/exchanges and picks best route for your trade.</li><li><strong>Intent Solver:</strong> system where user states desired outcome ("swap X for at least Y") and external solvers compete to fill it best.</li></ul><p>You do not need these to understand AMM basics. They matter later because they decide where order flow goes.</p></section><section class="card"><h2>First-Principles Questions for Uniswap v4</h2><ol><li>What state changes before swap, during swap, and after swap?</li><li>Can hook logic be manipulated by attackers?</li><li>How does hook change LP's risk/reward compared to plain pool?</li><li>If hook fails, does core accounting remain safe?</li></ol></section></main></body></html>
