# Module 08 Coursebook: Governance, Cash-Flow Rights, and Token Value

## Problem statement

High usage does not guarantee strong token value. Value depends on capture rights, supply policy, and governance credibility.

## Terms

- **Gross fees**: top-line fee collection.
- **Net fees**: after incentives/costs.
- **Fee capture**: portion reaching tokenholders.
- **Dilution**: supply expansion reducing per-token claim.
- **Governance capture**: concentrated control by few actors.

## Running example

Protocol net fees: 120M.

- Capture to tokenholders: 35% => 42M
- Supply: 300M -> 0.14/token annual flow

## Mechanism

1. Usage generates fees.
2. Governance allocates net flows.
3. Market prices expected future tokenholder claim under policy risk.

## Numerical examples

A) Capture cut to 20% => 24M => 0.08/token.

B) Supply expands to 360M with same 42M flow => 0.1167/token.

C) Same revenue, different governance trust can drive different multiples.

## Misconceptions

- "TVL/volume alone defines valuation" -> incomplete.

## Failure simulations

- Governance whale coalition redirects flows.
- Treasury spending without accountability erodes confidence.

## Checklist

1. Real tokenholder cash flow?
2. Emission and unlock schedule?
3. Voting concentration and emergency powers?

## Explain-it-back

1. What links protocol usage to token value?
- Captured, durable, and credible tokenholder cash flow.
2. Why can token lag protocol growth?
- Weak capture or heavy dilution.
3. Why governance quality matters?
- Policy instability increases risk discount.
