# Module 08: Governance and Valuation

## Objective

Evaluate governance power, fee capture, and token valuation as claims on protocol cash flow/control.

## First Principles

- Governance token value = cash-flow rights + control rights + reflexivity premium.
- Treasury and emissions policy can dominate near-term valuation.
- Delegation concentration can create governance capture.

## Worked Example

Protocol annual net fees = 120M.
- 35% directed to token stakers: 42M
- Circulating tokens = 300M
- Cash flow/token = 0.14 yearly before risk adjustment

Now test sensitivity:
- If fee capture falls from 35% to 20%, cash flow/token drops to 0.08

## Governance Failure Modes

- Voter apathy + whale dominance
- Parameter bribes misaligning long-term safety
- Upgrade key centralization

## Exercises

1. Build a simple token value sensitivity table.
2. Audit governance attack surface for one live protocol.
3. Distinguish revenue, fees, and tokenholder-accruing cash flow.
