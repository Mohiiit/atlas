# Beginner Content Structure Audit (DeFi + non-DeFi)

Date: 2026-02-21

Goal: extract reusable structure patterns for true beginner-friendly educational content.

## Sources Reviewed

### DeFi-focused

1. Ethereum.org - What is DeFi
- https://ethereum.org/az/defi/
- Pattern: short plain-language framing, FAQ style sections, progression from concept to use cases.

2. Investopedia - DeFi basics
- https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835
- Pattern: term-first explanations and risk notes, definition-led pedagogy.

3. Techopedia - DeFi overview
- https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34630/decentralized-finance-defi
- Pattern: table of contents, component breakdown, pros/cons, examples list.

### Non-DeFi educational references

4. Cloudflare Learning Center - What is DNS / DNS zone
- https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-dns/
- https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-zone/
- Pattern: analogy-driven teaching, "learning objectives", misconception correction.

5. Stripe Docs / educational guides
- https://docs.stripe.com/payments/use-cases/get-started
- https://docs.stripe.com/tour
- https://stripe.com/resources/more/payment-operations-101-a-guide-for-businesses
- Pattern: decision tree structure, step-based integration flow, progressive complexity.

## Structural Patterns That Work for Beginners

1. Problem-first entry
- Begin with "what problem is being solved" before introducing terminology.

2. Term unpacking before mechanism
- Each term is explained in plain language, then technical definition, then example.

3. Progressive depth
- Intuition -> process -> math -> edge cases -> risks.

4. Single running scenario
- Reusing same people and numbers reduces cognitive load.

5. Explicit misconception handling
- Good beginner content states common wrong mental models and corrects them.

6. Frequent local summaries
- End each section with 1-3 takeaway bullets.

7. Knowledge checks
- Short quiz or reflection prompts with answers.

8. Risk framing from the start
- Not an appendix. Risk appears alongside mechanism explanation.

## What This Means for DeFi Curriculum Rewrite

For each module page, include:

2. Core terms and definitions
3. Running example setup
4. Mechanism walkthrough
5. Worked numeric examples
6. Failure and stress scenarios
7. Mini quiz + answers
8. Practical protocol evaluation checklist
